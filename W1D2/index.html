    <h2 id="description">What is oatmeal?</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oatmeal">Oatmeal</a> is made of hulled oat grains – groats – that have either been milled (ground), steel-cut, or rolled. Ground oats are also called "white oats". Steel-cut oats are known as "coarse oatmeal" or "Irish oatmeal" or "pinhead oats". Rolled oats can be either thick or thin, and may be "old-fashioned" or "quick" or "instant".
